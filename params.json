{"name":"Villa Badoer","google":"","body":"**Villa Badoer** is a villa in Fratta Polesine in the Veneto region of northern Italy. It was designed in 1556 by Andrea Palladio for the Venetian noble Francesco Badoer, and built between 1557 and 1563, on the site of a medieval castle which guarded a bridge across a navigable canal. This was the first time Palladio used his fully developed temple pediment in the facade of a villa.\r\n![Villa Badoer in Fratta Polesine](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/48/Villa_Badoer_Fratta_Polesine_facciata_by_Marcok_2009-08-16_n08.jpg)\r\nVilla Badoer has been part since 1996 of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \"City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto\". The building is open to the public and one of the wings houses the National archeological museum of Fratta Polesine, opened in 2009.\r\n\r\n_[Source: Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Badoer)_\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Project Decomposition\r\n\r\nTo make this project, i decided to divide the work into 10 main parts, which follows:\r\n\r\n1. Frontal Side and Windows\r\n2. Stairs and Little Columns\r\n3. Left and Right Side\r\n4. Base\r\n5. Back Side\r\n6. Grates\r\n7. Pillars\r\n8. Roof\r\n9. Garden\r\n10. Extras\r\n\r\nHere is a few sketches made by me:\r\n![sketch1](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/images/Foto397.jpg)\r\n![sketch2](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/images/Foto398.jpg)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 1 - The frontal side and the windows\r\n\r\nThis part is full of base structures, which i used to create the walls, the windows and the doors, but there are also more complex structures. The hardest part is the front door's decoration, visible in white.\r\n![Frontal Side](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/frontal%20side.jpg)\r\nHere are some of the function used:\r\n\r\n1. SIMPLEX_GRID\r\n2. CYL_SURFACE\r\n3. STRUCT\r\n4. BEZIER\r\n5. NUBS (Transfinite Non-uniform B-Spline)\r\n6. BOUNDARY\r\n7. COLOUR\r\n\r\nand many others!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 2 - The beautiful stairs\r\n\r\nThis is one of the thoughest part of the work, and also the heaviest code in the project. Doing the stairs using simple CUBOIDs was to easy, and not so true to the model. So i decided to design one stair and multiply it. Also the little lateral column wasn't easy to do. It required do model a specific curve and rotate it.\r\n![Stairs and little columns](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/steps%20and%20columns.jpg)\r\nFor this part, here is a list of some functions used:\r\n\r\n1. NUBS\r\n2. BEZIER\r\n3. CUBOID\r\n4. S (Scale)\r\n5. T (Translation)\r\n6. TRIANGLE_STRIP\r\n\r\nand others!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 3 - The lateral sides\r\n\r\nThis part features the realization of both the left and rigth side, but it's not so difficult, because once created one side, the other one is very similar. I decided to begin with the left side, and to obtain a big part of the right side by using S([0])([-1])(); with this we obtain the mirroring. The 0 represent the X axis, and the -1 is the mirroring. Here is a picture of the left side: ![Left side of the villa](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/left%20side.jpg) In this screenshot we can also see the grates, presented later, in part 6. There are also the chimneys. There are 2 on the left side, and one on the right.\r\n\r\nA list of some function used:\r\n\r\n1. SIMPLEX_GRID\r\n2. STRUCT\r\n3. MAP\r\n4. BEZIER\r\n5. TRIANGLE_STRIP\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 4 - The base of the villa\r\n\r\nThis is one of the simplest part, and features a very few bucket of functions.\r\nHere is a snapshot: ![Base of the villa](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/base.jpg)\r\nThis represent the structure made of red bricks.\r\n\r\nAnd this are the only function used to realize it:\r\n\r\n1. CUBOID\r\n2. T\r\n3. STRUCT\r\n4. COLOUR\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 5 - The back side\r\n\r\nAnother not so difficult part is the representation of the back side of the villa, in which we can see a lot of windows and grates. ![Back of the villa](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/back%20side.jpg)\r\nAlso in this screen we can see the grates.\r\nHere is a list of some function used:\r\n\r\n1. SIMPLEX_GRID\r\n2. STRUCT\r\n3. CYL_SURFACE\r\n4. R (Rotate)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 6 - Finally the grates!\r\n\r\nYes, in this part i finally decided to represent the grates, that i have used later in all the four sides of the villa. I created the two types of grates, the little and the big ones, plus the gates. Here are the pictures:\r\n![Little grate](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/little%20grate.jpg)\r\n![Big grate](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/big%20grate.jpg)\r\n![The gate](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/gate.jpg)\r\nThe function used are some that we've already seen:\r\n\r\n1. CUBOID\r\n2. BOUNDARY\r\n3. CYL_SURFACE\r\n4. COLOUR\r\n\r\nHere is the code for creating the big one:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  function creaGrataInterna() {\r\n    var cilindro1 = drawCylinderPieno(0.01,1.7,10);\r\n    cilindro1 = R([1,2])(-PI/2)(cilindro1);\r\n    var cilindro2 = drawCylinderPieno(0.01,0.1,10);\r\n    cilindro2 = T([1,2])([0.01,-0.1])(cilindro2);\r\n    var cilindro3 = T([1])([1.68])(cilindro2);\r\n    var verticale = STRUCT([cilindro1, cilindro2, cilindro3]);\r\n\r\n    var cilindro4 = drawCylinderPieno(0.01,1.2,10);\r\n    cilindro4 = R([0,2])(-PI/2)(cilindro4);\r\n    var cilindro5 = drawCylinderPieno(0.01,0.1,10);\r\n    cilindro5 = T([0,2])([-0.01,-0.1])(cilindro5);\r\n    var cilindro6 = T([0])([-1.18])(cilindro5);\r\n    var orizzontale = STRUCT([cilindro4, cilindro5, cilindro6]);\r\n    orizzontale = T([0,1])([1.1,0.1])(orizzontale);\r\n    var verticali = [];\r\n    var orizzontali = [];\r\n    for(i=0;i<7;i++) {\r\n      verticali.push(T([0])([0.165*i])(verticale));\r\n    }\r\n    for(i=0;i<13;i++) {\r\n      orizzontali.push(T([1])([0.125*i])(orizzontale));\r\n    }\r\n    verticali = STRUCT(verticali);\r\n    orizzontali = STRUCT(orizzontali);\r\n\r\n    var struct = STRUCT([orizzontali, verticali]);\r\n    return black(struct);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n_I'm sorry, but the code it's not all english. Sometimes i feel myself more comfortable with italian names._\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 7 - The pillars\r\n\r\nIn this step i finally needed the pillars, so i began their realization. It's divided in three parts: the base (a CUBOID), the pillar (a cylindrical-like shape), and the capital. The last one is the most difficult to realize, and so i had to find a compromise between complexity and realism. I can say the final result isn't so bad.\r\nHere is a picture of the final structure, already assembled:\r\n\r\n(Upper part)\r\n![PillarUp](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/pillar_up.JPG)\r\n(Bottom part)\r\n![PillarDown](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/pillar_down.JPG)\r\n\r\nHere are some function used:\r\n\r\n1. NUBS\r\n2. ROTATIONAL_SURFACE\r\n3. MAP\r\n4. DOMAIN\r\n5. BEZIER\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 8 - The big red roof / The upper part\r\n\r\nOne of the most difficult part. It has a lot of structures to realize. It's not just a red roof... There is a window, the frontal part, the tubes for the rain... And not least, the decoration on the frontal part. The last one took me to define a NUBS curve with 27 points. The upper part also contains the wall's white brick decoration, which required a great precision.\r\nHere is some pictures:\r\n![The roof](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/roof.jpg)\r\n![The above view of the roof](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/roof%20view.jpg)\r\nAnd a part of the code to realize the X axis' brick translations:\r\n```javascript\r\n  function creaMattonatoX() {\r\n    var cube1 = CUBOID([0.1,0.1,0.2]);\r\n    var cubi = [];\r\n    for(i=0; i<=15.4; i=i+0.25){\r\n      cubi.push(T([0])([i])(cube1));\r\n    }\r\n    var struct = STRUCT(cubi);\r\n    struct = T([0,1,2])([-0.2,5.6,0.4])(struct);\r\n    return struct;\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nSome of the functions used are:\r\n\r\n1. CUBOID\r\n2. STRUCT\r\n3. TRIANGLE_STRIP\r\n4. R\r\n5. A user defined function to create Full Cylinders\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 9 - The gardens\r\nIn this i build an approximate representation of the gardens. Not much more to say... It's very simple. Contains only CUBOIDs and translations. Screenshot: ![The garden](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/garden.jpg)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Step 10 - Extras\r\nThis is the last part, in which i made some rearrangements to make the villa even more realistic. I corrected initials planning errors and added some other things. In the screenshot below, we can see the bottom borders of the villa, added at last:\r\n![Extras](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/extras.jpg)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### **_The model completed_**\r\n\r\nSo here it is! The moded it's all'assembled, and here are some screenshot from different views:\r\n![frontal](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/view%20frontal.jpg)\r\n![lateral](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/view%20lateral.jpg)\r\n![back](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/view%20back.jpg)\r\n![all](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/view%20total.jpg)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### **_Comparisons_**\r\n\r\nSo, in conclusion, here are some comparisons picture and screenshot from different points of view.\r\n\r\n**Frontal view:**\r\n![frontpic](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/images/badoer_facciata.jpg)\r\n![frontscr](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/CatturaS1.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Pillar view:**\r\n![pillarpic](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/images/badoer_facciata3.jpg)\r\n![pillarscr](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/CatturaS2.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Left view:**\r\n![leftpic](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/images/badoer_facciata4.jpg)\r\n![leftscr](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/CatturaS3.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Lateral (left) view:**\r\n![latpic](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/images/badoer_lateral.jpg)\r\n![latscr](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/CatturaS4.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Doors view:**\r\n![doorspic](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/images/badoer_loggia.jpg)\r\n![doorsscr](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/CatturaS5.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Back view:**\r\n![backpic](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/images/badoer_posteriore.jpg)\r\n![backscr](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/45798891/Villa%20Badoer/CatturaS6.jpg)\r\n\r\n_Link to the source code: [Project's folder](https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/418839/tree/master/final-project)_","note":"Don't delete this file!
